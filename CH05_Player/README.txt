CH05_Player

This example uses an Audio Queue to play an audio file in any Core Audio-supported format. The path to the file to play is set as the kPlaybackFileLocation macro at the top of main.c.

The program runs as a command-line executable and takes no arguments, meaning you need to either run it from the command line in the Derived Data build directory, or directly from Xcode.

March 13, 2014: This example has been modernized for Xcode 5.1, and has been converted to ARC. There are no code changes compared to what's in the book.
